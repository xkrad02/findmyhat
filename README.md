# Reflection

## What did you like about this project?
This project is very different from what I have done before. Creating my first game was rather tedious but also a great experience, especially when I can get it to work the way I want it to.

## What did you struggle with in this project?
2D array is still a bit confusing to me. As a lot of stuff was covered in JavaScript, I find it difficult to apply what I have learnt. I had to look back on certain topics covered to know what to write in the codes.

## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I believe I require more practice before attempting this project, but trying to understand the concepts have taken up a lot of my time. It was great that Jean took the time to go through the assessment with us. Without the initial guidance I might not have been able to start this project â˜¹
