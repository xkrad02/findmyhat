## Overview

### Criteria
- Code is clean and well written
- Code has good overall performance and correctly incorporates the concepts learnt during the JavaScript module

### Game Requirements
-	Create a 10 X 10 Field
-	The character * can be always at the default of position (0,0) when the user starts the game
-	The controls for the character are:
○	Up = u key

○	Left = l key
○	Right = r key
-	If a user entered an invalid key (e.g. p or t), output “Enter (u, d, l or r.) and allow the user to enter again
-	The number of holes generated should be lesser than the fields generated
-	When the character drops into a hole, output “Sorry, you fell down a hole!” and the game ends
-	When the character hits the boundaries, output “Out of bounds - Game End!” and the game ends
-	When the character gets the hat, output “Congrats, you found your hat!” and and the game ends

### Reflections

- What did you like about this project?
This project is very different from what I have done before. Creating my first game was rather tedious but also a great experience, especially when I can get it to work the way I want it to.

- What did you struggle with in this project?
2D array is still a bit confusing to me. As a lot of stuff was covered in JavaScript, I find it difficult to apply what I have learnt. I had to look back on certain topics covered to know what to write in the codes.

- What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I believe I require more practice before attempting this project, but trying to understand the concepts have taken up a lot of my time. It was great that Jean took the time to go through the assessment with us. Without the initial guidance I might not have been able to start this project ☹
